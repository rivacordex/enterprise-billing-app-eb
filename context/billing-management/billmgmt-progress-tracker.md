# Progress Tracker

Update this file after every meaningful implementation change.

## Current Phase

- Phase 1 — Bill Run module build (bottom-up, one vertical unit per pass).

## Current Goal

- bm01 + bm02 delivered: the Billing nav section, RBAC scaffold, the
  `billing.bill_run` header table, lazy materialization, and the two-tab run
  list. Next: bm03 (Trigger — snapshot accounts / Run).

## Completed

- **bm01 — Billing section & RBAC scaffold** (`specs/bm01-billing-section-rbac-scaffold.md`).
  Auth/RBAC + app shell only; no domain tables.
  - Permission registry: `billrun_view` / `billrun_operate` / `billrun_approve`
    added to `PERMISSION_NAMES` (`types/rbac.ts`) + typed `PERMISSIONS.BILLRUN_*`
    constants (`auth/permission-constants.ts`). Rows land in migration
    `0024_billrun_permissions.sql` (`INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`).
  - Seeded role: `BILLING_VIEWER` added to `SEEDED_ROLE_NAMES` (protected by
    `isSeededRole`). Created + granted by the new `db/seeds/billing.ts`
    (`db:seed-billing`, wired into `db:setup`): BILLING_VIEWER → `billrun_view:READ`;
    ADMIN → `billrun_view:READ`, `billrun_operate:EDIT`, `billrun_approve:EDIT`.
    Idempotent (role pre-check + `onConflictDoNothing` on grants).
  - Route/page/states: `app/(app)/billing/bill-runs/{page,loading,error}.tsx` —
    `BillRunsPage` guards `billrun_view:READ` then renders `BillRunsEmptyState`
    (`components/billing/bill-runs-empty-state.tsx`, server component, scaffold
    empty state; no data fetch, no StubDataBanner, no CTA).
  - Nav: `Billing` section (`ReceiptText` icon, `billrun_view:READ`
    requiredPermission → fail-closed lock) inserted between Accounts and
    Administration in `components/admin-nav.tsx`.
  - Route × level matrix test: `tests/app/bill-runs-page.test.tsx`
    (granted → renders; no grant → /no-access; unauthenticated → /login).

- **bm02 — Bill Runs list + lazy materialization**
  (`specs/bm02-bill-runs-list-materialization.md`).
  - Schema: new `billing.bill_run` header table + `bill_run_seq` (`BRN` id),
    full plan §6.1 column set (materialize subset populated, rest nullable for
    later units), `(ref_bill_cycle_id, period_start)` UNIQUE + status/run_type/
    approver CHECKs. Migration `0025_skinny_calypso.sql` (drizzle-kit generated;
    reviewed). `db/schema/billing/bill-run.ts`, exported via the billing index.
  - Config: `STUB_DATA_MODE` env flag (`lib/config.ts` + `.env.example`) +
    frozen `stubDataMode` accessor.
  - Types: `RunStatus`/`RunType`/`RunListRow`/`RunListPage` (`types/billing.ts`);
    new `BILL_RUN_MATERIALIZED` audit event (Additive category).
  - Derivation: pure, total `currentDuePeriod(cycleDay, today)`
    (`services/billing/derive-periods.ts`) — single most-recent due period,
    current-month-anchored (no backfill), `null` when this month's run date
    hasn't arrived. `todayInZone` boundary helper added to `lib/timezone.ts`.
  - Repository: `insertMissingRuns` (ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING, RETURNING only
    inserted) + tab/cycle/status-filtered `listRuns`
    (`db/repositories/billing/bill-run.repository.ts`).
  - Services: `materializeDueRuns` (one txn, skips non-monthly with a logged
    note, one `BILL_RUN_MATERIALIZED` audit row per inserted, no-actor system
    write) and read `list-runs` (derived operability: oldest past-due
    `< APPROVED`; `*_FAILED` stays operable; upcoming disabled; `pastDue`).
  - Page + UI: `billing/bill-runs/page.tsx` guards → parses searchParams
    (`validation/billing/bill-runs-list.schema.ts`) → materializes → lists.
    Components: `BillRunList` (tabs via `<Link ?tab=>`, grouped Current +
    paginated Historical), `RunActionCard` (Run button inert — bm03),
    `RunStatusBadge` (11 states), `bill-runs-filters`, `bill-runs-pagination`,
    `StubDataBanner`/`StubBadge`, `ExportRunsButton`. Calendar dates via new
    `formatCalendarDate`.
  - CSV export: `actions/billing/export-runs.action.ts` (`'use server'`,
    re-checks `billrun_view:READ`, full filtered set, hand-rolled CSV, not
    audited); client `Blob` download.
  - Tests: `currentDuePeriod` unit (1/15/28, none-due-yet, month/year
    boundary), materialize service (monthly due / non-monthly skip / no-op
    zero-audit), list-runs operability + filters + pagination, CSV action,
    `RunStatusBadge` all 11, rewritten page route×level + stub-banner,
    integration idempotency (`tests/db/materialize-runs.integration.test.ts`,
    concurrent → exactly one row).

## In Progress

- None.

## Post-review hardening (bm02)

Fixes from a high-effort code review of the bm02 diff:

- **CSV/formula injection** — extracted the shared, formula-safe `lib/csv.ts`
  `csvField` (prefixes `= + - @ \t \r`, then RFC-4180 quotes); the bill-run
  export now uses it and `services/accounts/journal-csv.ts` was de-duplicated
  onto it (single hardening site).
- **Status filter is tab-scoped** — the filter UI shows Status only on
  Historical (terminal options); the read service drops an incompatible status
  (ignored on Current, non-terminal ignored on Historical), so operability is
  always resolved over a cycle's full non-terminal set and the "always-empty
  dead-end" is gone.
- **Pagination** — `listRuns` counts only when paginating and **clamps an
  out-of-range `?page=`** to the last real page (no false "no runs" empty
  state); repository split into `countRuns` + rows-only `listRuns`. Extracted
  the shared `components/common/list-pagination.tsx` (`noun` prop, `pageSize>0`
  guard); audit-log + bill-run paginations now delegate to it.
- **Page resilience** — lazy `materializeDueRuns` is wrapped so a failed write
  degrades to a logged error and still renders existing runs; the cycle list +
  run list run via `Promise.all`; the cycle filter / "no cycles" empty state
  now use `listActiveBillCycles` (matches what materialization iterates).
- **One business `today`** resolved once (`services/billing/business-today.ts`)
  and threaded into both materialize + list (no midnight-straddle skew).
- **Download** — `ExportRunsButton` defers `revokeObjectURL` so a larger
  download isn't cancelled.

Full DB-free vitest run green except the 4 pre-existing date-dependent action
suites; `typecheck`/`lint`/`format:check` clean.

## Next Up

- **bm03** — snapshot accounts / Run trigger (the Run button is inert in bm02).

## Open Questions

- None for bm01.

## Architecture Decisions

- **Permission names are snake_case** (`billrun_view/operate/approve`), matching
  the delivered Accounts pattern; docs (architecture §4, code-standards §7/§8)
  already reflect this and the `/billing/bill-runs` route.
- **Three permissions, not one with levels** — segregation of duties (four-eyes):
  operate and approve must be grantable to different people.
- **Permission rows in a migration; grants in a seed** — established split
  (`0023`/`db:seed-ordering` precedent).
- **`billrun_*` are optional permissions** (`types/permissions.ts`
  `OptionalPermissionName`) — the resolver omits ungranted permissions and users
  predating the module hold none; this also prevents rippling `null` into every
  hardcoded `EffectivePermissionMap` fixture (same um06/pm25 move).

## Session Notes

- Context docs live under `context/billing-management/` (matches AGENTS.md).
  The folder was renamed from an earlier `billling-management` (triple-l) typo.
- Adding the three permission names required mechanical fixture updates in
  `tests/{auth/resolver, services/roles-read.service, components/{admin-nav,
  permission-matrix-editor,role-detail}}` (permission count 11 → 14) and
  registering `/billing/bill-runs` in `tests/app/route-manifest.test.ts` — the
  same ripple pm25 handled when it added the two ordering permissions.
- Pre-existing, unrelated: the 4 date-dependent action suites
  (`create-order`, `resume/suspend/terminate-subscription`) fail on the clean
  baseline too (hardcoded dates now >3 days in the past vs. 2026-08-19).
- **bm02 ripples** from the new `BILL_RUN_MATERIALIZED` audit event +
  `STUB_DATA_MODE` config field: mechanical updates to
  `tests/components/audit-log-filters.test.tsx` (option count 62 → 63) and
  `tests/lib/config.test.ts` (full-config `toEqual` gains `STUB_DATA_MODE`),
  same class of ripple bm01's permission-count change caused. `typecheck` /
  `lint` / `format:check` / `validate:env` all clean; full DB-free vitest run
  green except the 4 pre-existing date suites above.
- **bm02 migration `0025` was generated (`db:generate`) and reviewed but NOT
  applied** — no local Postgres is reachable in this environment, so
  `db:migrate` (and the DB-backed `materialize-runs.integration.test.ts`) must
  be run wherever the database lives. The generated SQL is the clean
  sequence + table + unique + 3 CHECKs + `BRN` default + 3 FKs.
- **Window-derivation decision (recorded so it isn't re-litigated):**
  `currentDuePeriod` is *current-month-anchored* — it considers ONLY this
  month's `cycle_day` and returns `null` when `today` is before it. This is
  what implements "no multi-month backfill": a month whose page was never
  opened between its run date and the next is never retro-created; an earlier
  `SCHEDULED` run already materialized simply stays operable oldest-first via
  the list read. The plan docs `_newmodule-billing-billrun-plan.md` /
  `bm00-build-plan.md` referenced by the spec are not in the repo, so the
  bm02 spec (Design §Structural) was the authoritative source.
